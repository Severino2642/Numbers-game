# Numbers-game


### 📱 Description :

This application is a digital version of the classic **Numbers Game**, developed using a modern architecture with **C# (.NET)** for the backend and **Angular** for the frontend.

#### ⚙️ Key Features:

- **Random number generation**: The system randomly selects 6 numbers (including units, tens, and large numbers like 25, 50, 75, 100) along with a **target number** between 100 and 999.
- **Calculation system**: Users can select numbers and apply operations (+, −, ×, ÷) to try and reach the target number.
- **Solution checker**: Once a solution is submitted, the C# backend validates the answer and provides feedback on how close it is to the correct result.
- **Integrated timer**: Each game is time-limited (e.g., 45 seconds) to simulate the original game’s challenge.
- **User-friendly interface**: Thanks to Angular, the interface is smooth, responsive, and accessible on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

#### 🧠 Objective:
Provide users with a fun and interactive way to practice mental math, either solo or in future multiplayer modes.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, HTML/CSS  
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core (C#), RESTful APIs
